THE ASCENT: A PILGRIM'S INSTRUCTION MANUAL

You are the Jumping King. Your quest is simple, yet maddeningly difficult: ascend the desolate vertical tower to reach the top and find the legendary, Smoking Hot Babe. This is a game of precision, patience, and absolute control.

1. THE CORE MECHANIC: THE JUMP

The Jump is the only tool you possess, and mastery is mandatory.

Charging: Hold the Jump Button (typically SPACEBAR or the corresponding controller button) to initiate a charge.

Trajectory: As you charge, the arc and strength of your jump are displayed by the King's posture. The longer you hold, the farther and higher you will leap.

Release: Release the Jump Button to launch.

Commitment: Once airborne, the trajectory is FIXED. You cannot adjust your path mid-air. You are fully committed to your chosen leap.

3. THE RULES OF GRAVITY

A. The Only Way is Up

The game is a single, continuous, vertical map. There are no save points or checkpoints within the ascent.

B. Falling is Progress... Lost

Every successful jump gains you ground, but every missed jump, slip, or mistimed landing will result in a fall. You will fall until you land on solid ground or hit the bottom of the current screen.

Progress is measured not by time, but by vertical location. A single mistake can easily cost you ten minutes of strenuous effort.

C. Platforms and Edges

Ledges: To climb onto a platform, you must land directly on top of it. Landing on the side or grazing the edge will result in a fatal slide and fall.

Momentum: The King has subtle momentum. Ensure you are completely stationary before initiating a crucial jump charge.

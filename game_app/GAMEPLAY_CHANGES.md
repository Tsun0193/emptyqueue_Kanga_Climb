# Game Changes Summary âœ…

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Health Increase on Landing
**Feature**: Kangaroo gains health when landing on each platform for the first time
- **Health Increase**: +2 health points per new platform
- **One-time bonus**: Each platform can only give health once (tracked with `landed` property)
- **Max health cap**: Health cannot exceed 100 (maxJoeyHealth)
- **Console log**: Shows health increase for debugging
- **Ground platform**: Does not give health (starts as already landed)
- **Victory platform**: Can give health bonus

**Implementation**:
```javascript
if (!platform.landed) {
    platform.landed = true;
    const healthIncrease = 2;
    this.joeyHealth = Math.min(this.maxJoeyHealth, this.joeyHealth + healthIncrease);
}
```

### 2. âœ… Random 1-2 Platforms Per Level
**Change**: Each level now has randomly 1 or 2 platforms instead of 2-3
- **Previous**: 2-3 platforms per level
- **Current**: 1-2 platforms per level
- **Distribution**: 50% chance of 1 platform, 50% chance of 2 platforms
- **Difficulty**: Increased challenge with fewer platforms

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const numPlatforms = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 1 : 2;
```

### 3. âœ… Smaller Platform Width (1-2 Blocks)
**Change**: Platform width reduced from 4-5 blocks to 1-2 blocks
- **Previous**: 4-5 blocks wide (128-160 pixels)
- **Current**: 1-2 blocks wide (32-64 pixels)
- **Block size**: Each block is 32x32 pixels
- **Height**: Still random 2-3 blocks (unchanged)
- **Difficulty**: Smaller landing area = more challenging jumps

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const blocksWidth = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); // 1 or 2
```

## Game Balance Impact

### Difficulty Increase
- **Fewer platforms** (1-2 per level) = Fewer options to climb
- **Smaller platforms** (1-2 blocks) = Harder to land precisely
- **More challenging gameplay** overall

### Health System Balance
- **Health recovery**: +2 per platform landed
- **With fewer platforms**: Health recovery is slower
- **Strategy**: Players must be careful not to fall (losing progress and health opportunities)
- **Starting health**: 50 (Joey is sick)
- **Maximum health**: 100 (fully healed at Sky Garden)

### Example Climb Scenario
1. **Start**: Joey's health at 50
2. **Land on 5 platforms**: Health increases to 60 (50 + 5Ã—2)
3. **Continue climbing**: Each successful landing rewards health
4. **Reach top**: Joey fully healed, Sky Garden reached!

## Testing Tips

### To test health increase:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for: "Landed on new platform! Health: XX"
3. Watch the health bar at top of screen increase
4. Land on same platform again - no additional health (already marked as landed)

### To test platform difficulty:
1. Notice smaller platforms (1-2 blocks wide)
2. Only 1-2 platforms per level to choose from
3. Requires more precise jumping
4. More strategic gameplay

## Benefits

âœ… **Health reward system** - Encourages climbing and rewards progress  
âœ… **Increased challenge** - Smaller and fewer platforms test skill  
âœ… **Better gameplay loop** - Risk/reward balance  
âœ… **Strategic decisions** - Choose platforms carefully  
âœ… **Visual feedback** - Health bar shows progress  

## Adjustable Parameters

You can easily tweak these values in the code:

### Health per platform:
```javascript
const healthIncrease = 2; // Change to 3, 5, etc.
```

### Platforms per level:
```javascript
const numPlatforms = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 1 : 2; // Change probabilities
// Example for 1-3 platforms:
// const numPlatforms = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
```

### Platform width:
```javascript
const blocksWidth = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); // 1 or 2
// Change to 2 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) for 2-3 blocks
```

Enjoy the enhanced gameplay! ðŸ¦˜ðŸ’š

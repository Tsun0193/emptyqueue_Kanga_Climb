# üéÆ How to Add Your Background Image

## The Problem
Your game is showing a gradient because `background.png` is missing from the `game_app` folder.

## The Solution

### Quick Steps:

1. **Find the background image** you attached in your FIRST message (the beautiful vertical pixel art showing forest at top, waterfalls, and industrial buildings at bottom)

2. **Save it to your computer:**
   - Right-click on that image in VS Code chat
   - Select "Save Image As..."
   - Navigate to: `d:\RMIT\game_app\`
   - **Important:** Name it exactly: `background.png` (all lowercase)

3. **Verify the file:**
   ```
   d:\RMIT\game_app\
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.png  ‚Üê This file must exist!
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.js
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
   ```

4. **Refresh your game:**
   - Go back to your browser
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)
   - The background should now appear!

## Alternative: Download from Chat

If you can't right-click the image:
1. Look for the image attachment in your first message
2. There should be a download icon or option
3. Download it and move it to `d:\RMIT\game_app\`
4. Rename to `background.png`

## Check if it Worked

Open your browser console (F12) and look for:
- ‚úÖ Success: "Background image loaded: 720 x 1280" (or similar dimensions)
- ‚ùå Error: "Failed to load background image"

If you see the error, the file is not named correctly or in the wrong folder.

## Still Not Working?

Run this command in PowerShell to check:
```powershell
Test-Path "d:\RMIT\game_app\background.png"
```

If it says `False`, the file is not there yet.

**Note:** The background image MUST be named exactly `background.png` (lowercase) and placed in the `game_app` folder for the game to find it.

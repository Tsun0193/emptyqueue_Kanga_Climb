# Game Mechanics Documentation - "Kanga's Climb"

## 1. Core Game Mechanic: Precision Jumping

### 1.1 The Kangaroo Jump System
**Primary Mechanic**: Kanga's natural kangaroo jumping ability serves as the sole movement mechanic, emphasizing precision and commitment over speed.

#### Jump Charging Mechanism
- **Input**: Hold SPACEBAR (keyboard) or A/X button (controller)
- **Visual Feedback**: Kanga crouches and leans, with her posture indicating jump trajectory and power
- **Power Arc**: The longer the charge, the higher and farther the jump
- **Maximum Charge**: 3-second hold for maximum distance/height

#### Trajectory Commitment
- **No Mid-Air Control**: Once Kanga leaves the ground, the trajectory is fixed
- **Physics-Based**: Realistic gravity and momentum simulation
- **Risk vs Reward**: Longer charges = greater distance but higher risk of overshooting

#### Landing Mechanics
- **Precise Landing**: Must land directly on platform surfaces
- **Edge Detection**: Landing on platform edges or sides results in sliding and falling
- **Momentum Consideration**: Kanga retains slight forward momentum after landing

### 1.2 Environmental Integration with Jumping

#### Pollution Effects on Jumping (Bottom Third)
- **Reduced Visibility**: Heavy smog obscures landing zones
- **Unstable Platforms**: Trash platforms may collapse or shift after landing
- **Toxic Hazards**: Polluted areas cause slight screen shake, affecting jump precision
- **Joey's Distress**: Audio cues of joey's coughing may distract timing

#### Transition Zone Mechanics (Middle Third)
- **Improving Conditions**: Gradually clearing smog improves visibility
- **Mixed Platforms**: Combination of unstable trash and emerging natural platforms
- **Wind Effects**: Clean air pockets may provide slight lift assistance
- **Joey's Recovery**: Encouraging sounds as joey's health improves

#### Clean Environment Benefits (Top Third)
- **Crystal Clear Visibility**: Perfect view of all landing opportunities
- **Stable Natural Platforms**: Reliable tree branches, rock ledges, and vegetation
- **Helpful Elements**: Vines, leaves, or wind currents may assist jumps
- **Joey's Joy**: Energetic cheering provides positive reinforcement

## 2. Platform and Environment Design

### 2.1 Platform Types and Behaviors

#### Trash Platforms (Polluted Zone)
- **Instability**: May tilt, break, or collapse after landing
- **Size Variation**: Irregular shapes requiring precise landing spots
- **Visual Cues**: Wobbling, creaking sounds indicate instability
- **Hazard Integration**: Some platforms surrounded by toxic gas clouds

#### Transition Platforms (Middle Zone)
- **Hybrid Nature**: Mix of metal debris and growing vegetation
- **Conditional Stability**: Some platforms become stable when approached correctly
- **Growing Elements**: Platforms may extend or sprout helpful branches over time
- **Recovery Indicators**: Clean spots gradually expanding on platforms

#### Natural Platforms (Clean Zone)
- **Solid Reliability**: Tree branches, rock outcroppings never fail
- **Organic Shapes**: Natural curves and surfaces that feel alive
- **Interactive Elements**: Flowers that bloom when landed on, birds that chirp
- **Generous Landing**: Slightly more forgiving edge detection

### 2.2 Vertical Progression System

#### Screen-Based Progression
- **Continuous Vertical Map**: Single, unbroken vertical journey
- **No Checkpoints**: Falling results in sliding down to last stable platform
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each third of the game has distinct challenge scaling
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Visual progression tells the pollution recovery story

#### Fall Consequences
- **Gravity Physics**: Realistic falling with increasing speed
- **Distance Penalties**: Major falls can cost 5-10 minutes of progress
- **Environmental Damage**: In polluted zones, falls may trigger additional hazards
- **Emotional Impact**: Joey's distressed sounds during major falls

# Project Overview - Social Impact Web Game

## 1. Objective

### Primary Goal
Develop a web-based game using AI/LLM assistance that highlights and addresses a pressing social challenge in Vietnam or Australia. The game must be educational, impactful, and entertaining, providing players with fresh perspectives on important real-world issues.

### Key Outcomes
- Create awareness about a chosen social issue
- Foster empathy and understanding
- Inspire positive action and behavior change
- Demonstrate effective use of AI tools in game development
- Deliver a complete, playable web experience

## 2. Required Screens/Views

### Menu/Welcome Screen (`index.html` initial view)
- **Title** of the game prominently displayed
- **Brief description** of the social issue and game goal
- A prominent **"Start Game"** button
- (Optional) "How to Play" or "Credits" link/button
- Clean, engaging visual design that sets the tone for the game

### Play Screen
- The main **game area/board** as the central focus
- **Player status/stats** (e.g., score, resource count, health, progress indicators)
- **Core interactive elements** (e.g., dice, cards, board spaces, action buttons)
- **Game narrative/prompts** displayed to guide and educate the player
- **Clear visual feedback** for actions and game state changes
- Intuitive user interface with responsive controls

### Game Over/Results Screen
- Appears upon game completion (win or lose scenarios)
- **Final Score/Outcome** with meaningful metrics
- A brief, impactful **message** related to the social issue
- Educational summary of lessons learned or actions inspired
- A **"Play Again"** button for replay functionality
- (Optional) Social sharing features or calls-to-action

## 3. Themes

### Suggested Social Issues (Choose One)
- **Climate change & sustainability** - Environmental awareness and green practices
- **Access to education** - Educational inequality and opportunities
- **Mental health & wellbeing** - Mental health awareness and support systems
- **Social equity & inclusion** - Diversity, equality, and fair representation
- **Community resilience** - Building stronger, more connected communities
- **Other locally relevant issues** specific to Vietnam or Australia context

### Theme Integration Requirements
- Gameplay mechanics must **directly connect** to the chosen social issue
- Educational content should be naturally woven into the game experience
- Game narrative should reflect real-world challenges and solutions
- Visual and audio elements should support the thematic message

## 4. Tech Stack

### Core Technologies (Required)
- **HTML** - Structure and content markup
- **CSS** - Styling, layout, and visual design
- **JavaScript** - Game logic, interactivity, and dynamic behavior

### Development Constraints
- Front-end only implementation (no backend required)
- Must run fully in browser without additional installations
- 2D graphics (3D optional if technically feasible)
- No server-side dependencies or setup requirements

### Supported Libraries/Frameworks
- Any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries/frameworks are permitted
- Popular options may include:
  - Game engines: Phaser.js, Three.js, p5.js
  - UI frameworks: Bootstrap, Materialize
  - Animation libraries: GSAP, Anime.js
  - Audio libraries: Howler.js, Web Audio API

### AI Tools Integration
- **Game Development**: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, Gemini
- **Asset Generation**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Leonardo AI
- **Audio Generation**: Suno, Udio, or similar AI audio tools
- **Code Assistance**: Any LLM or AI coding platform

## 5. Game Format Options

### Acceptable Game Types
- **Board Game** - Digital adaptation of traditional board game mechanics
- **Card Game** - Strategy or educational card-based gameplay
- **Dice Game** - Chance and strategy elements using virtual dice
- **Simple Web Game** - Any engaging format suitable for browser play

### Gameplay Requirements
- Educational value directly tied to social issue
- Engaging and fun player experience
- Clear win/lose conditions
- Meaningful player choices and consequences
- Replayability factor

## 1. Game Story Overview

### The Setting
The world (stylized Australia) has been consumed by "The Great Smog" - a massive pollution cloud that has settled at the lowest points of the continent. What was once a thriving ecosystem has become a colossal, world-spanning landfill and trash mountain.

### The Problem
- The entire lower world is covered in thick, toxic smog

- **Motivation**: Her joey (baby kangaroo) is sick from pollution exposure
- **Background**: Lives at the bottom of the polluted world
- **Goal**: Reach the legendary "Sky Garden" to find clean air and healing

### The Legend
Kanga has heard ancient stories of the **"Sky Garden"** or **"The Great Tree"** - a pristine, clean sanctuary existing at the very top of the world, above all the smog and pollution. This mythical place is said to have the power to heal both land and creatures.
